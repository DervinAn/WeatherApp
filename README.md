Weather Forecast Application
Overview
The Weather Forecast Application is a modern, user-friendly Android app built using Jetpack Compose that provides real-time weather updates and multi-day forecasts. The app integrates with a reliable third-party weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to deliver accurate and up-to-date weather information. It adheres to the Clean Architecture pattern, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and testability.

Features
Real-Time Weather Data: Displays current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.
Multi-Day Forecast: Provides an intuitive interface for viewing weather predictions over the next 7 days.
Location-Based Services: Automatically detects the user's location or allows manual input for specific cities/regions.
Dark/Light Theme Support: Offers dynamic theming based on user preferences or system settings.
Error Handling & Offline Mode: Handles network failures gracefully and provides meaningful feedback in offline scenarios.
Unit Testing & UI Testing: Ensures reliability through comprehensive unit tests and UI tests.
Technical Details
Architecture
Clean Architecture: Separates the app into distinct layers (Presentation, Domain, Data) for better organization and maintainability.
Presentation Layer: Built with Jetpack Compose for a modern, declarative UI.
Domain Layer: Contains business logic and use cases.
Data Layer: Manages data sources (API, local storage).
API Integration
Integrated with a third-party weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) using Retrofit for efficient HTTP requests.
Used Moshi/Gson for JSON parsing to handle API responses effectively.
Implemented a specialized Result class and interface to encapsulate API responses, enabling consistent handling of success, error, and loading states.
State Management
Utilized ViewModel to manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-aware manner.
Used LiveData or StateFlow for reactive state management, ensuring smooth updates to the UI.
Error Handling
Developed robust error-handling mechanisms to address potential issues such as network failures, invalid API responses, or unexpected exceptions.
Implemented retry logic and fallback strategies to enhance the app's resilience.
UI/UX Design
Built the user interface using Jetpack Compose , leveraging its declarative approach to create modern, interactive, and visually appealing layouts.
Ensured accessibility compliance by adhering to Material Design guidelines and incorporating features like proper contrast ratios, scalable text sizes, and semantic labels.
